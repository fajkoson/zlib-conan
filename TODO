BUGS,
- many packages has bug in conandata, refferencing version on in two digit number f.e 1.3 instead of 1.3.0 which causes build to fail

- downlaod patch: https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes/doxygen/all
- download conanfile
- put it into desired folder structure (/doxygen)
- run conan install (currently still need to create manually the profile but when i get to work i should be able to fix)
- run conan create 
- run conan upload . doxygen/1.9.4@tescan/stable
